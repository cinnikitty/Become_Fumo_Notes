fun glitches:
soul edge trail - attack and unequip soul edge while it is swinging
had to do it to em pose - cast fishing rod and unequip the rod very quickly after
walking emote - equip fishing rod, use emote, unequip rod
super speed/jumpable emote - do emote while touching grass
middair stop - do a still emote middair after being hit by the comedy machine 3000 or while on top of someone
(untested)constantly flying - hit someone with pink sword, person that was hit leaves game during landing animation, then you get hit to move again

badges:
memento mori - no character
nil - madotsuki
when they cry - rika furude
in due time - inu sakuya
dimensional duo - tsubakura, yabusame
nano desu☆ - hanyuu
dreaming - urotsuki

the big crystal and the small crystal for the badges both make sounds when they appear and when they disappear

non-badge special characters:
chistmas nero - join during christmas or december (unsure which one)

specific character affects:
madotsuki - spawns with a unique weapon, the knife
urotsuki - spawns with a unique weapon, the chainsaw
sekibanki - saying head drops your head
sagume - puts parenthesis around everything you say
inu sakuya - has reversed gravity when using rocket jumper

specifics on how multiple voicelines at the same time work:
you can say all the species lines at the same time, but only one character line at a time
side note (patchouli doesnt follow this logic and can say both her character lines at the same time for some reason)
for example: 
aya can do chirp and ayaya at the same time
marisa can NOT do ze~ and marisad at the same time
urotsuki can NOT do any of their voicelines at the same time (no!, don't!, and stop it!)
kyouko can do wann, awoo, and yahoo at the same time, and wann, awoo, and good morning at the same time, but NOT wann, awoo, yahoo, and good morning

due to this, wannawoo isnt its own thing, its just a combination people use a lot and doesnt need to be included

voice lines:
⬆ means higher pitched
