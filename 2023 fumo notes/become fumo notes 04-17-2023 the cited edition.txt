disclaimers ▮▮▮▮
everything in here has been tested to be true (unless specified otherwise) but things do change and i do make mistakes so, test things yourself and tell if something's wrong or should be added
to me taunts are the ones in the hand wave menu and emotes are the /e commands, but i USED to use them interchangeably so, if something doesnt make sense to you then that could explain it
i tried to figure out what the items were references to and named them accordingly, but i might be wrong on some or not know the reference, also can someone please tell me why i named the pink sword giga sword cause i cant find it anywhere and dont want to change it if it was right
the cited person is just the first person that i learned something from, but i started crediting way late into the making of this so most of this cant be credited, sometimes i discover stuff independently of others so its hard to know if i learned from someone else or not
if a person has a ▶ next to their name when cited that means they have a youtube channel (a youtuber being cited doesnt mean they have it in a video, sometimes they told or showed me it ingame), otherwise assume its their roblox username
all channels that were cited or linked to will be in the ###referenced youtube channels section of the ▮▮▮▮links

fun glitches ▮▮▮▮
soul edge trail - attack and unequip soul edge while its swinging (has red trail)
walking taunt (ice cream version)- use a still taunt, eat ice cream until frozen (preserves the emote's original state and can be used to make up for the shortcomings of rod glitches)
super speed/jumpable emote - touch grass then do any moving taunt
middair taunt - do a still taunt while in the air after being hit by the comedy machine 3000 or while on top of top of someone, then have that person move away if doing second method
flying pose - hit someone with giga sword, person that was hit leaves game just before hitting the ground, then get hit to move again
become fish - use rocket jumper in water (for consistent setup, swim up against a wall with a ledge above it so that you look as if you were standing on normal ground, and shoot directly between your legs at the wall)(this can be done in gm_construct area)(btw if you wait to float up to the top in small pool then use sit button you often land upside down)(also using rod will stop your animation only for others, you cant see the change)
super speed hoverboard - moving taunt, equip hoverboard
high hoverboard (stackable) - have 2 hoverboards, switch between them to gain height and lose speed
slowfall hoverboard - using rocket jumper and equipping hoverboard makes you float much higher up and fall a lot slower
hoverboard smuggling - method 1(better but requires help). in the gm_construct, have the hoverboard in your inventory but not equipped, stand against the door, have someone potemkin buster you and they exit the area (timing for grab is to click to grab just as circle finishes filling)(grabbing a small character requires the grabber to sit first)
		     - method 2(worse but doesnt require help). reset character in block world (door in campfire cave), go to scarlet devil mansion (red portal on pillar next to bouncy house), on the platform area that has the inu-sakuya box go to the opposite end of inu-sakuya, use a moving emote and launch yourself far into the ends of the void until you find block area again, clip into the area, equip hoverboard while going through door (if you re-equip hoverboard afterwards you die)
ice speed - using a moving taunt on the ice in the whiterock village makes you move super fast
shrimp speed - use shrimp fry, wait until youve started smoking to touch grass, moving taunt to fix (stacking decreases jump height)
funny voice - going really far out and causing the usual roblox bugginess also affects tts, can maybe be done in gmod area with inu sakuya and rocket jumper
space buddies - using rocket jumper as inu-sakuya makes you go upwards, can be stopped by sitting
clipping - still taunt (mainly rock paper scissors) can be used to clip someone through a thin wall
super explosion - use still taunt at comedy machine 3000 and get hit over and over again to get dense and loud explosion
permant marisad - say "but you dodged it!" or "marisad" as marisa twice in quick succesion, fix with character change or reset (copy and paste recommended if you type slow)
sky camera - reset while being hit by the pink sword, camera will separate from your body and stay wherever you died at and your body wont despawn, change character or rejoin to fix(can be to same character you already are)
high jump (sit version) - sit and jump at the same time but make sure the sit happens first (the key to doing this consistently is to hold down the space bar while in the air, and know that you only sit when you let go of the click, this probably has something to do with the multiple jump sounds on success)
high jump (other versions) - either equipping the lunarian tech gun or doing the the walking taunt (either version)(this seems to work with the other high jump, letting you get just a tiny bit higher of a jump)
easy lay (from @fomufan564) - sit down, eat fries, touch grass
(emote is intented) walking emote (from ▶ leautb) - moving taunt, get stopped from moving by a wall, do an emote, turn on shiftlock, 
frozen in time (from @thenewrigob) - if on pc and not fullscreen, hold right click on the border at the top of the game, your position will be frozen until you let go (this appear for others) and your animations will pause then resume when you unpause (this is client side only)
fry box hitbox (from ▶ leautb) - eating fries makes a hitbox that interacts with people that have anti grief off even if you have anti grief on (lets you push sitting people over and do funky stuff with the pushable ball, also when you mess with the ball it seems to desync it or smth)
rotate seat (stackable)(from ▶ leautb) - person sitting on seat uses chair, person off of seat hits the person on the seat with chair
lunarian tech gun weird shooting (from ▶ leautb) - after you use the rocket jumper (jumping and shooting the ground so you have smoke particles) you can shoot the lunarian tech gun in (probably) any position once before you have to do it again

fishing rod glitches ###
had to do it to em/goku drip pose - cast fishing rod and unequip the rod as fast as you can
walking taunt (rod version) - use taunt, unequip rod
walking fishing (taunt version) - fish, use a moving taunt, stop emoting
walking fishing (chair version) - use chair, switch to rod, start fishing (lets you turn around normally unlike taunt version)
straight legs - equipping then unequipping fishing rod while sitting down will straighten your legs for others
invincibility - literally just hold the rod

voice lines ▮▮▮▮

specifics on how voice lines work ###
Voice lines can effectively be split into two categories, character lines and species lines
Character lines are unique to that character, while species lines are shared between characters of the same species or animal
You can say all the species lines at the same time, but only one character line at a time
side note patchouli and koishi dont follow this rule and can say all their lines at the same time for some reason, maybe they have their lines set as species lines?
for example -
aya can do chirp and ayaya at the same time
marisa can NOT do ze~ and marisad at the same time
urotsuki can NOT do any of their voicelines at the same time (no!, don't!, and stop it!)
kyouko can do wann, awoo, and yahoo at the same time, and wann, awoo, and good morning at the same time, but NOT wann, awoo, yahoo, and good morning

due to this, wannawoo isnt its own thing, its just a combination people use a lot and doesnt need to be included

⬆ means higher pitched

notes and tidbits ▮▮▮▮

badges related ==
the big crystal and the small crystal for the badges both make sounds when they appear and when they disappear (which can be used to tell where they spawn), also the spots for the crystal have changed from the video in the useful links
you can get up to the platform for the dreaming key by having someone else throw a pipe bomb, which is probably easier for non-pc players
(crackpot theory)the train you use to get the nil badge has an invisible hitbox that you can find by running along the track (might require anti grief off), it's very wonky and teleports you around, but i think it is the actual hitbox for getting teleported, so assuming this is correct, if you can have a friend stand on top of it and time it based off of where your friend is standing instead of the front of the train and all othe conditions are correct, you should always get teleported

glitch related ==
the super speed/jumpable emote glitch was changed to be slower but more controllable in the halloween 2022 update
the drip pose glitch affects all animations, seriously, try out everything that has an animation
the shrimp speed glitch can be stacked for more speed but decreased jump height, eventually you cant jump at all, so you can use the sit button to get out of chairs and stand up again
the fishing rod cancels all animations when you unequip it, which is super wack and has some crazy applications in every aspect of the game
the had to do it to em/goku drip pose will work no matter how early you do it, it can only fail if you do it too late
(from ▶ leautb) if you shoot the rocket jumper while going through a portal, like you would with the gloves in the hoverboard smuggling method 1, the rocket will follow you
if someone pauses then you move somewhere and taunt, when they unpause you will appear to be in the same spot you were when they paused but now taunting, they can even interact with you even though you look normal to others (this can be used to do weird stuff like teleport up to places and get both players up to a high spot by one person helping the other up while paused then climbing up from the desynced verion of the taunting player)

item related ==
backspace can be used to unequip items
(from @Endercreeper990) pipe bombs work on taunting players, can hit people through walls, and have wide enough range to hit people on top of a tree if thrown under it
you can turn your giga sword into a knife by having someone leave after youve hit them with the sword, it resets next time you hit someone with that sword, also you get stuck when you do this so you need something to unstuck yourself, gloves fixes fully, any moving emote, fishing rod, or ice cream gets you out of the air, and
it takes 5 ice cream eats to get frozen
you can only shoot the lunarian tech gun once while sitting, you have to re-sit to shoot it again

location related ==
there are 2 holes in the invisible barrier in whiterock village, one on top of the hill surrounding the village at the top left side (if the looked at from above with the entrance at the bottom), and one big one in the sky cause the barrier only goes up so far

other ==
urotsuki uses a different sound for anti grief toggle, ive heard people say that its because the sound came from yume nikki, so since urotsuki is from yume 2kki, it uses the sounds from that instead
during november there was a door next to the changelogs board that had 202 on it, the door lead to a spooky bedroom that had fixed camera angles, i know it was a reference to an old horror game, but forgot which one
the floor is a grid... im sure it seems obvious when i say it but i doubt many people really looked at it and conciously saw the grid
when using garmond font for funni text, if you put two a's next to eachother they compress into an a with a line above it
spicy nuggets turn on the lights in the dark area of gm construct
despite having cat ears and a tail, rika furude doesnt have cat voice lines
the edges of the top of the rock you use to get onto the trees for rocket jumper are slopes, so you have to stand in the middle or you wont get enough height
santa nero was not given out on christmas 2022 :( no santa nero for me
max thickness for rich text uistroke is 50, anything above just renders as 50
when laying on her back, clowpiece make it look like there are 3 tennis balls on the ground
you can get under a lot of tables by moving taunting into the side of the table then sitting
