everything in here has been tested to be true (unless specified otherwise) but things do change and i do make mistakes so test things yourself and tell if something's wrong or should be added
to me taunts are the ones in the hand wave menu and emotes are the /e commands, but i used to use them interchangeably so just assume if you see emote that i mean taunt (except for the emotes list of course)

derpy your opinion doesn't matter you eat cold creamy mayonnaise for fun
bombproofhorse (reference is that, in jackbox we played fibbage, and the question was something along the lines of "book voted to be oddest book title is 'how to bomb proof your ____'" and the answer was apparently horse, which completely destroyed our sense of how weird the answers in that game would be)

fun glitches ▮▮▮▮
soul edge trail - attack and unequip soul edge while it is swinging
walking emote ice - use a still emote, eat ice cream until frozen (preserves the emote's original state and can be used to make up for the shortcomings of rod glitches)
super speed/jumpable emote - do any moving taunt while touching grass
middair stop - do a still emote middair after being hit by the comedy machine 3000 or while on top of someone
constantly flying - hit someone with pink sword, person that was hit leaves game just before hitting the ground, then get hit to move again
become fish - use rocket jumper in water (for consistent setup, swim up against a wall with a ledge above it so that you look as if you were standing on normal ground, and shoot directly between your legs at the wall)(this can be done in gm_construct area)(btw if you wait to float up to the top in small pool then use sit button you often land upside down)(also using rod will stop your animation only for others, you cant see the change)
super speed hoverboard - moving emote then equip hoverboard
high hoverboard (stackable) - have 2 hoverboards, switch between them to gain height and lose speed
slowfall hoverboard - using rocket jumper and equipping hoverboard cause you to float a much higher up and fall a lot slower
hoverboard smuggling - method 1(better but requires friend). in the gm_construct, have the hoverboard in your inventory but not equipped, stand against the door, have someone potemkin buster you and they exit the area (timing for grab is to click to grab just as circle finishes filling)(grabbing a small character requires the grabber to sit first)
		     - method 2(worse but doesnt require friend). reset character in block world (door in campfire cave), go to scarlet devil mansion (red portal on pillar next to bouncy house), on the platform area that has the inu-sakuya box go to the opposite end of inu-sakuya, use a moving emote and launch yourself far into the ends of the void until you find block area again, clip into the area, equip hoverboard while going through door (if you re-equip hoverboard afterwards you die)
ice speed - using a moving taunt on the ice in the whiterock village makes you move super fast
hungry speed - use shrimp fry, wait until youve started smoking to touch grass (emoting fixes any problems and its stackable but decreases jump height)
funny voice - going really far out and causing the usual roblox bugginess also affects tts, can maybe be done in gmod area with inu sakuya and rocket jumper
straight legs - equipping then unequipping fishing rod while laying down will make your legs seem straightened out to others
space buddies - using rocket jumper as inu-sakuya makes you go upwards, can be stopped by sitting
clipping - still taunt (mainly rock paper scissors) can be used to clip someone through a thin wall
super explosion - use still taunt at comedy machine 3000 and get hit over and over again to get dense and loud explosion
permant marisad - say "but you dodged it!" or "marisad" as marisa twice in quick succesion (copy and paste recommended if you type slow)(only turns off on character change or reset)
sky camera - reset while being hit by the pink sword, camera will separate from your body and stay wherever you died at and your body wont despawn, change character to fix(can be to same character you already are)
high jump - sit and jump at the same time but make sure sit happens first, you will be to reach weird places or use shortcuts

voice lines ▮▮▮▮

specifics on how voice lines work ###
Voice lines can effectively be split into two categories, character lines and species lines
Character lines are unique to that character, while species lines are shared between characters of the same species or animal
You can say all the species lines at the same time, but only one character line at a time
side note patchouli and koishi dont follow this rule and can say all their lines at the same time for some reason, maybe they have their lines set as species lines?
for example -
aya can do chirp and ayaya at the same time
marisa can NOT do ze~ and marisad at the same time
urotsuki can NOT do any of their voicelines at the same time (no!, don't!, and stop it!)
kyouko can do wann, awoo, and yahoo at the same time, and wann, awoo, and good morning at the same time, but NOT wann, awoo, yahoo, and good morning

due to this, wannawoo isnt its own thing, its just a combination people use a lot and doesnt need to be included

⬆ means higher pitched

notes and tidbits▮▮▮▮
the big crystal and the small crystal for the badges both make sounds when they appear and when they disappear (which can be used to tell where they spawn), also the spots for the crystal have changed from the video in the useful links
(crackpot theory)the train you use to get the nil badge has an invisible hitbox that you can find by running along the track (might require anti grief off), it's very wonky and teleports you around, but i think it is the actual hitbox for getting teleported, so assuming this is correct, if you can have a friend stand on top of it and time it based off of where your friend is standing instead of the front of the train, you should always get teleported
the super speed/jumpable emote glitch was changed to be slower but more controllable in the halloween 2022 update
the had to do it to em/goku drip pose glitch affects all animations, seriously, try out everything that has an animation
the hungry speed glitch can be done multiple times for more speed but decreased jump height, eventually you cant jump at all, so you can use the sit button to get out of chairs and stand up again
urotsuki uses a different sound for anti grief toggle, ive heard people say that its because the sound came from yume nikki, so since urotsuki is from yume 2kki, it uses the sounds from that instead
during november there was a door next to the changelogs board that had 202 on it, the door lead to a spooky bedroom that had fixed camera angles, i know it was a reference to an old horror game, but forgot which one
the floor is a grid... im sure it seems obvious when i say it but i doubt many people really looked at it and conciously saw the grid
when using garmond font for funni text, if you put two a's next to eachother they compress into an a with a line above it
the fishing rod cancels all animations when you unequip it, which is super wack and has some crazy applications in every aspect of the game
spicy nuggets turn on the lights in the dark area of gm construct
despite having cat ears and a tail, rika furude doesnt have cat voice lines
backspace can be used to unequip items, which is good for the had to do it to em/goku drip pose glitch cause its easier to click then press backspace than to click, move to the unequip button, and click again
the had to do it to em/goku drip pose will work no matter how early you do it, it can only fail if you do it too late
