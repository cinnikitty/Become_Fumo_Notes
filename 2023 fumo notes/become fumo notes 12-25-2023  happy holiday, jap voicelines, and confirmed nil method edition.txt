categories are signified using ▮▮▮▮ ### == - in that order

beginner's guide ▮▮▮▮
These notes were originally made just to keep track of things i find out about become fumo,
especially things i would use often but are hard to remember.
Now with how much info i have in here it can be overwhelming,
so heres things you should know if using these notes when new to the game:

1. With the exception of the "beginner's guide ▮▮▮▮" category,
entries wont be split into mulitple lines for ease of reading,
so every line is its own entry and will need to be scrolled side to side to be read entirely.

2. Other than the "beginner's guide ▮▮▮▮" and "pre-notes info ▮▮▮▮" categories,
the categories are generally ordered from most often used to least used, top to bottom.
Things that you only really need once (usually when starting) may be near the bottom.

3. Locations can be hard to describe in text so i tend to avoid it,
because of that i didnt add my own instructions on getting badges.
I instead linked instructions for badges in "links ▮▮▮▮" (as mentioned in the next point).

4. Things you might want to check out as a beginner are:
• The all badges video playlist in "links ▮▮▮▮"
• The rich text markup documents in "links ▮▮▮▮",
so you can understand how the copypaste texts work.
• Some commonly useful glitches are shrimp speed, clipping, high jump (both versions),
had to do it to em/goku drip pose, walking taunt (usually rod version), invincibility,
all of which can be found in "fun glitches ▮▮▮▮".

5. You can search for certain words by holding control (ctrl) and pressing f,
which can be helpful in finding the things mentioned in the previous point.

pre-notes info ▮▮▮▮
everything in here has been tested to be true (unless specified otherwise), but things do change and i do make mistakes so, test things yourself and tell me if something's wrong or should be added
to me taunts are the ones in the hand wave menu and emotes are the /e commands, but i previously used them interchangeably so, even though i cleaned it up everywhere i found, if something doesnt make sense to you then that could explain it
i tried to figure out what the items were references to and named them accordingly, but i might be wrong on some or not know the reference, also can someone please tell me why i named the pink sword giga sword cause i cant find it anywhere and dont want to change it if it was right
the cited person is just the first person that i learned something from, but i started crediting way late into the making of this so most of this cant be credited, sometimes i discover stuff independently of others so its hard to know if i learned from someone else or not
if a person has a "▶" next to their name when cited that means they have a youtube channel (a youtuber being cited doesnt mean they have it in a video, sometimes they told or showed me it ingame), otherwise assume its their roblox username
all channels that were cited or linked to will be in the "referenced youtube channels ###" section of the "links ▮▮▮▮"

you can open emojis menu using windows key + period or semicolon, but these are here for quick access or if you cant do that

fun glitches ▮▮▮▮
soul edge trail - attack and unequip soul edge while its swinging (has red trail)
walking taunt (ice cream version)- use a still taunt, eat ice cream until frozen (preserves the emote's original state and can be used to make up for the shortcomings of rod glitches)
super speed/jumpable emote - touch grass then do any moving taunt
middair taunt - do a still taunt while in the air after being hit by the comedy machine 3000 or while on top of top of someone, then have that person move away if doing second method
flying pose - hit someone with giga sword, person that was hit leaves game just before hitting the ground, then get hit to move again
become fish - use rocket jumper in water (for a consistent setup, swim up against a wall with a ledge above it so that you look as if you were standing on normal ground, and shoot directly between your legs at the wall)(this can be done in gm_construct area)(btw if you wait to float up to the top in small pool then use sit button you often land upside down)(also using rod will stop your animation only for others, you cant see the change)
super speed hoverboard - moving taunt, equip hoverboard
high hoverboard (stackable) - have 2 hoverboards, switch between them to gain height and lose speed
slowfall hoverboard - using rocket jumper and equipping hoverboard makes you float much higher up and fall a lot slower
hoverboard smuggling - method 1(better but requires help): in the gm_construct, have the hoverboard in your inventory but not equipped, stand against the door, have someone potemkin buster you and they exit the area (timing for grab is to click to grab just as circle finishes filling)(grabbing a small character requires the grabber to sit first)
		     - method 2(worse but doesnt require help): turn your graphics up to 10 or at least 9, reset character in block world (door in campfire cave), go to scarlet devil mansion (red portal on pillar next to bouncy house), go to inu sakuya box, use a moving emote with the hoverboard to launch yourself off end (the one that has a sort of red opening where there is no pillar)(you can start the board on the opposite end of the platform so you have a lot more speed which makes it faster to get there), then keep going forward until you find block area again, get above it and fall into the area (or unequip the board while above)(you lose control for a few seconds and face a specfic direction whenever you get brought back up to the top so go to the side of the area where you will be going towards in when you get brought to the top to make it way easier)(i tested and you cant use the high hoverboard glitch to get in cause once you get on top the roof is solid for some reason, though if you want to stand on top of bloc			     - method 2 continued - k world there you go), equip hoverboard while going through door (if you re-equip the hoverboard afterwards you die)
ice speed - using a moving taunt on the ice in the whiterock village makes you move super fast
shrimp speed - use shrimp fry, wait until youve started smoking to touch grass, moving taunt to fix (stacking decreases jump height)
funny voice - going really far out and causing the usual roblox bugginess also affects tts, can maybe be done in gmod area with inu sakuya and rocket jumper
space buddies - using rocket jumper as inu-sakuya makes you go upwards, can be stopped by sitting
clipping - still taunt (mainly rock paper scissors) can be used to clip someone through a thin wall
super explosion - use still taunt at comedy machine 3000 and get hit over and over again to get dense and loud explosion
permant marisad - say "but you dodged it!" or "marisad" as marisa twice in quick succesion, fix with character change or reset (copy and paste recommended if you type slow)
sky camera - reset while being hit by the pink sword, camera will separate from your body and stay wherever you died at and your body wont despawn, change character or rejoin to fix
high jump (sit-jump version) - sit and jump at the same time but make sure the sit happens first, the key to doing this consistently is to turn before and while youre jumping and hold down the space bar while in the air (or at least i think you should hold jump cause of the multiple jump sounds on success), also know that you only sit when you let go of the click
high jump (item version) - either equipping the laser gun, soda, or doing the walking taunt glitch(either version)(this seems to work with the sit-jump version of high jump, letting you get just a tiny bit higher/mor consistent jump when combined)
easy lay (from @fomufan564) - sit down, eat fries, touch grass
(emote is intented) walking emote (from ▶ leautb) - moving taunt, unequip rod to break animation, hold laser gun or get stopped from moving by a wall, do an emote, turn on shiftlock (not required if using laser gun but needed for turning), hold s if done by walking into wall
frozen in time (from @thenewrigob) - if on pc and not fullscreen, hold right click on the border at the top of the game window, your position will be frozen until you let go (this appear for others) and your animations will pause then resume when you unpause (this is client side only)
fry box hitbox (from ▶ leautb) - eating fries makes a hitbox that interacts with people that have anti grief off even if you have anti grief on (lets you push sitting people over and do funky stuff with the pushable ball, also when you mess with the ball it seems to desync it or smth)
rotate seat (stackable)(from ▶ leautb) - person sitting on seat uses chair, person off of seat hits the person on the seat with chair
laser gun weird shooting (from ▶ leautb) - after you use the rocket jumper (jumping and shooting the ground so you have smoke particles) you can shoot the laser gun in (probably) any position once before you have to do it again
toy stealing (from ▶ leautb) - use buster gauntlets while at either the taiko drums or at time crisis 4 in the arcade
slide decoy (from ▶ ruisudesu) - on top of slide, do still taunt or start fishing (only possible if the slide is next to water), slide down it, now you will appear to be at the bottom of the slide to others, if anyone interacts with you, you will teleport to the top of the slide, if you sit in a chair you will teleport to it for others, once you sit in a chair you are unable to sit in another one until you undo the taunt, once you undo the taunt you will appear to others that you teleport to wherever you are on your screen
background change - method 1(from inside area you want): i'll (probably) come back and put these in some other time
		  - method 2(from overworld): oh god how many versions have i put this off? imma have to ask ruisu how to do this again cause no way can i find the recording lmao
inu liftoff (from ▶ leautb) - lay on your back as inu sakuya and use the chair, you will fly upwards
high control shrimp speed (from ▶ ruisudesu) - do shrimp speed glitch until you have the speed you want, then do the walking taunt (rod version) with a still taunt to have control over changing directions as if you were moving at a normal speed
pipe bomb knockback deny - sitting quickly after being sent flying by a pipe bomb will stop you mid air, though you will still not be able to move for the remaining stun duration

fishing rod glitches ###
had to do it to em/goku drip pose - cast fishing rod and unequip the rod as fast as you can
walking taunt (rod version) - use taunt, unequip rod
walking fishing (taunt version) - fish, use a moving taunt, stop emoting
walking fishing (chair version) - use chair, switch to rod, start fishing (lets you turn around normally unlike taunt version)
straight legs - equipping then unequipping fishing rod while sitting down will straighten your legs for others
invincibility - literally just hold the rod


rod invincibility affects ==

totsugeki
chair
soul edge
giga sword
laser gun
buster gauntlets
lightning
murasama
chainsaw

voice lines ▮▮▮▮

specifics on how voice lines work ###
Voice lines can effectively be split into two categories, character lines and species lines
Character lines are unique to that character, while species lines are shared between characters of the same species or animal
You can say all the species lines at the same time, but only one character line at a time
side note patchouli and koishi dont follow this rule and can say all their lines at the same time for some reason, maybe they have their lines set as species lines?
for example -
aya can do chirp and ayaya at the same time
marisa can NOT do ze~ and marisad at the same time
urotsuki can NOT do any of their voicelines at the same time (no!, don't!, and stop it!)
kyouko can do wann, awoo, and yahoo at the same time, and wann, awoo, and good morning at the same time, but NOT wann, awoo, yahoo, and good morning

due to this, wannawoo isnt its own thing, its just a combination people use a lot and doesnt need to be included

⬆ means higher pitched

notes and tidbits ▮▮▮▮

badges related ==
WE NOW HAVE 100% CONFIMATION ON HOW TO GET NIL BADGE BY OKUECHI HIMSELF. in ▶ GuardianZET's video "Join me. Become Fumo." Okuechi essentially gives him a tour around become fumo including telling him how to get every secret character, and at 22:16 okeuchi explains how to get nil badge (https://youtu.be/5HfMfw-9Nmo?si=Ni9Ze13uq_xyvjZm&t=1336). literally the only requirements is that you stand on top of the block and reset, you dont need to sit, time of day doesnt matter, no timing required, its just a 10% chance of it working
the big crystal and the small crystal for the badges both make sounds when they appear and when they disappear (which can be used to tell where they spawn), also the spots for the crystal have changed from the video in the useful links
you can get up to the platform for the dreaming key by throwing or having someone else throw a pipe bomb, which is probably easier for mobile players players

glitch related ==
the super speed/jumpable emote glitch was changed to be slower but more controllable in the halloween 2022 update
the drip pose glitch affects all animations, seriously, try out everything that has an animation
the shrimp speed glitch can be stacked for more speed but decreased jump height, eventually you cant jump at all, so you can use the sit button to get out of chairs and stand up again
the fishing rod cancels all animations when you unequip it, which is super wack and has some crazy applications in every aspect of the game
the had to do it to em/goku drip pose will work no matter how early you do it, it can only fail if you do it too late
(from ▶ leautb) if you shoot the rocket jumper while going through a portal, like you would with the gloves in the hoverboard smuggling method 1, the rocket will follow you
if someone pauses then you move somewhere and taunt, when they unpause you will appear to be in the same spot you were when they paused but now taunting, they can even interact with you even though you look normal to others (this can be used to do weird stuff like teleport up to places and get both players up to a high spot by one person helping the other up while paused then climbing up from the desynced verion of the taunting player)
the toy stealing glitch seems to put the toys at their default spawnpoint, you can tell this because they end up in the same spot as when you use the rod to break the animation
(from ▶ ruisudesu) doing the slide decoy glitch in hell makes it so that you dont get teleported out when you fall into the lava and you instead just fall under the map
i tried using inu liftoff with an akyuu on top of me when there was a glitch that let akyuu collide with people while having anti grief on, i couldnt lift her up and it flipped me to face down
slide decoy glitch stops you from bouncing in the bouncy castle and from going through the big crystal where hanyuu is, theres probably more interactions it stops though
stealing the taiko sticks with the toy stealing glitch makes it easy to see the rotation of your arms

backspace can be used to unequip items
(from @Endercreeper990) pipe bombs work on taunting players, can hit people through walls, and have wide enough range to hit people on top of a tree if thrown under it
you can turn your giga sword into a knife by having someone leave after youve hit them with the sword (during the part in the animation where the sword is a knife), it resets next time you hit someone with that sword, also you get stuck when you do this so you need something to unstuck yourself, gloves fixes fully, any moving emote, fishing rod, or ice cream gets you out of the air, and
it takes 5 ice cream eats to get frozen
you can only shoot the laser gun once while sitting, you have to re-sit to shoot it again
bike is useful for telling how close you are to the edge of something/if you will fall off, just turn sideways and you have a line down the middle of you
the maximum amount of items you can carry is 20

there are 2 holes in the invisible barrier in whiterock village, one on top of the hill surrounding the village at the top left side (if the looked at from above with the entrance at the bottom), and one big one in the sky cause the barrier only goes up so far

other ==
urotsuki uses a different sound for anti grief toggle, ive heard people say that its because the sound came from yume nikki, so since urotsuki is from yume 2kki, it uses the sounds from that instead
during november there was a door next to the changelogs board that had 202 on it, the door lead to a spooky bedroom that had fixed camera angles, i know it was a reference to an old horror game, but forgot which one
the floor is a grid... im sure it seems obvious when i say it but i doubt many people really looked at it and conciously saw the grid
when using garmond font for rich text, if you put two a's next to eachother they compress into an a with a line above it
spicy nuggets turn on the lights in the dark area of gm construct
despite having cat ears and a tail, rika furude doesnt have cat voice lines
the edges of the top of the rock you use to get onto the trees for rocket jumper are slopes, so you have to stand in the middle or you wont get enough height to get onto the tree
santa nero was not given out on christmas 2022 :( no santa nero for me (edit: yes santa nero for me >:) )
max thickness for rich text uistroke is 50, anything above just renders as 50
when clownpiece lays on her back it looks like there are 3 tennis balls on the ground, alternatively you can stand with your back against a wall to achieve the same effect
you can get under a lot of tables by moving taunting into the side of the table then sitting
you can layer people inside eachother and make a la creatura by sitting on a seat then pressing the sit button twice (make sure antigrief is off)
you can also layer people inside eachother anywhere with some help by having one person stand still and do a still taunt over and over so the people that interact with them get put in the same spot
bong bong, eiki, remilia, and yoshika all have unusual skin colorsa
you can say /c system to talk in a muted chat, which lets you do commands silently(this works on all of roblox), i learned this when i played kohls admin house as a kid since the game was all about using commands (though people in that game were able to see your commands with /log and also you probably shouldnt play that game anymore cause its extremely out of date and probably vulneranble hacks that can harm your account)
there have been 3 times okuechi has given out santa nero that i know of, once in christmas 2021 (i wasnt there for it but heard of it later), once right after the update that addeed the bisexual flag colors dimension (i was there and ,
