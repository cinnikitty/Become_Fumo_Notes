copypaste text for friend lol:
derpy your opinion doesn't matter you eat cold creamy mayonnaise for fun
bombproofhorse (reference is that in jackbox we played fibbage, and the question was something along the lines of "book voted to be oddest book title is 'how to bomb proof your ____'" and the answer was apparently horse, which completely destroyed our sense of how weird the answer in that game would be)

fun glitches:
soul edge trail - attack and unequip soul edge while it is swinging
had to do it to em/goku drip pose - cast fishing rod and unequip the rod very quickly after
walking emote rod - equip fishing rod, use emote (or use emote before rod), unequip rod
walking emote ice - use a still emote, eat ice cream until frozen (can be used to make up for the shortcomings of rod glitches)
super speed/jumpable emote - do any moving emote while touching grass
middair stop - do a still emote middair after being hit by the comedy machine 3000 or while on top of someone
(untested)constantly flying - hit someone with pink sword, person that was hit leaves game during landing animation, then you get hit to move again
walking fishing - fish, use a moving emote, stop emoting
become fish - use rocket jumper in water
super speed hoverbaord - moving emote then equip hoverboard
high hoverboard (stackable) - have 2 hoverboards, switch between them to gain height and lose speed
slowfall hoverboard - using rocket jumper and equipping hoverboard cause you to float a much higher up and fall a lot slower
hoverboard smuggling - method 1(better but requires friend). in the gm_construct, have the hoverboard in your inventory but not equipped, stand against the door, have someone potemkin buster you and they exit the area
		     - method 2(worse but doesnt require friend). reset character in block world (door in campfire cave), go to scarlet devil mansion (red portal on pillar next to bouncy house), on the platform area that has the inu-sakuya box go to the opposite end of inu-sakuya, use a moving emote and launch yourself far into the ends of the void until you find block area again, clip into the area, equip hoverboard while going through door (if you re-equip hoverboard afterwards you die)
ice speed - using a moving emote on the ice in the whiterock village makes you move super fast
hungry speed (stackable but decreases jump height)- use shrimp fry, wait until a second after you're set on fire to touch grass, doing this in a different order produces some weird effects... (emoting fixes any problems)
funny voice - going really far out and causing the usual roblox bugginess also affects tts, can maybe be done in gmod area with inu sakuya and rocket jumper
straight legs - equipping then unequipping fishing rod while laying down will make your legs seem straightened out to others
space buddies - using rocket jumper as inu-sakuya inverts gravity, can be stopped by sitting

badges:
memento mori - no character
nil - madotsuki
when they cry - rika furude

non-badge special characters:
chistmas nero - join game during christmas

characters with alternates:
keine - Keine EX
reisen - "Impreishable Night"
youmu - Sword Saint

specific character affects:
madotsuki - spawns with a unique weapon, the knife
urotsuki - spawns with a unique weapon, the chainsaw
sekibanki - saying head drops your head
sagume - puts parenthesis around everything you say
inu sakuya - has reversed gravity when using rocket jumper (glitch maybe? added to glitches too just in case)

specifics on how voice lines work:
Voice lines can effectively be split into two categories, character lines and species lines
Character lines are unique to that character, while species lines are shared between characters of the same species or animal
You can say all the species lines at the same time, but only one character line at a time
side note (patchouli and koishi dont follow this rule and can say all their lines at the same time for some reason, maybe they have their lines set as species lines?)
for example -
aya can do chirp and ayaya at the same time
marisa can NOT do ze~ and marisad at the same time
urotsuki can NOT do any of their voicelines at the same time (no!, don't!, and stop it!)
kyouko can do wann, awoo, and yahoo at the same time, and wann, awoo, and good morning at the same time, but NOT wann, awoo, yahoo, and good morning

due to this, wannawoo isnt its own thing, its just a combination people use a lot and doesnt need to be included

‚¨Ü means higher pitched

notes and tidbits:
the big crystal and the small crystal for the badges both make sounds when they appear and when they disappear (which can be used to tell where they spawn), also the spots for the crystal have changed from the video in the useful links
(crackpot theory)the train you use to get the nil badge has an invisible hitbox that you can find by running along the track (might require anti grief off), it's very wonky and teleports you around, but i think it is the actual hitbox for getting teleported, so assuming this is correct, if you can have a friend stand on top of it and time it based off of where your friend is standing instead of the front of the train, you should always get teleported
the super speed/jumpable emote glitch was changed to be slower but more controllable in the halloween 2022 update
the had to do it to em/goku drip pose glitch affects all animations, seriously, try out everything that has an animation
the hungry speed glitch can be done multiple times for more speed but decreased jump height, eventually you cant jump at all, so you can use the sit button to get out of chairs and stand up again
urotsuki uses a different sound for anti grief, ive heard people say that its because the sound came from yume nikki, so since urotsuki is from yume 2kki, it uses the sounds from that instead
during november there was a door next to the changelogs board that had 202 on it, the door lead to a spooky bedroom that had fixed camera angles, i know it was a reference to an old horror game, but forgot which one
