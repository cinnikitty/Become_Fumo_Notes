It is highly suggested that you use the most up to date note file, whether that be a named edition or a wip edition.    
These notes are for infomation about the roblox game become fumo, which you can find here: https://www.roblox.com/games/6238705697/Become-Fumo    
You can download the txt document by clicking download raw file at the top right once youve opened a specific one.

Also thanks to leautb for suggesting to use github.
