It is highly suggested that you use the most up to date named edition version of the notes or the wip notes.
These notes are for infomation about the roblox game become fumo, which you can find here: https://www.roblox.com/games/6238705697/Become-Fumo
You can download the txt document by clicking download raw file at the top right once youve opened a specific one.

Also thanks to leautb for suggesting to use github.
