the big crystal and the small crystal for the badges both make sounds when they appear and when they disappear

specific character affects:
madotsuki - spawns with a unique weapon, the knife
urotsuki - spawns with a unique weapon, the chainsaw
sekibanki - saying head drops your head
sagume - puts parenthesis around everything you say
inu sakuya - has reversed gravity when using rocket jumper

specifics on how multiple voicelines at the same time work:
you can say all the species lines at the same time, but only one character line at a time
for example: 
aya can do chirp and ayaya at the same time
marisa can NOT do ze~ and marisad at the same time
urotsuki can NOT do any of their voicelines at the same time (no!, don't!, and stop it!)
kyouko can do wann, awoo, and yahoo at the same time, and wann, awoo, and good morning at the same time, but NOT wann, awoo, yahoo, and good morning

due to this, wannawoo isnt its own thing, its just a combination people use a lot and doesnt need to be included
