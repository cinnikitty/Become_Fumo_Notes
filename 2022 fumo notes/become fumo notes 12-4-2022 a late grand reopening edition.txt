fun glitches:
soul edge trail - attack and unequip soul edge while it is swinging
had to do it to em/goku drip pose - cast fishing rod and unequip the rod very quickly after
walking emote - equip fishing rod, use emote (or use emote before rod), unequip rod
super speed/jumpable emote - do any moving emote while touching grass
middair stop - do a still emote middair after being hit by the comedy machine 3000 or while on top of someone
(untested)constantly flying - hit someone with pink sword, person that was hit leaves game during landing animation, then you get hit to move again
walking fishing - fish, use a moving emote, stop emoting
become fish - use rocket jumper in water
ice speed - using a moving emote on the ice in the whiterock village makes you move super fast
hungry speed (stackable but decreases jump height)- use shrimp fry, wait until a second after you're set on fire to touch grass, doing this in a different order produces some weird effects... (emoting fixes any problems)
(untested) funny voice - going really far out and causing the usual roblox bugginess also affects tts, can maybe be done in gmod area with inu sakuya and rocket jumper
straight legs - equipping then unequipping fishing rod while laying down will make your legs seem straightened out to others

badges:
memento mori - no character
nil - madotsuki
when they cry - rika furude
in due time - inu sakuya
dimensional duo - tsubakura, yabusame
nano desu‚òÜ - hanyuu
dreaming - urotsuki

non-badge special characters:
chistmas nero - join game during christmas

specific character affects:
madotsuki - spawns with a unique weapon, the knife
urotsuki - spawns with a unique weapon, the chainsaw
sekibanki - saying head drops your head
sagume - puts parenthesis around everything you say
inu sakuya - has reversed gravity when using rocket jumper

specifics on how voice lines work:
Voice lines can effectively be split into two categories, character lines and species lines.
Character lines are unique to that character, while
You can say all the species lines at the same time, but only one character line at a time.
side note (patchouli and koishi dont follow this rule and can say all their lines at the same time for some reason, maybe they have their lines set as species lines for some reason?)
for example: 
aya can do chirp and ayaya at the same time
marisa can NOT do ze~ and marisad at the same time
urotsuki can NOT do any of their voicelines at the same time (no!, don't!, and stop it!)
kyouko can do wann, awoo, and yahoo at the same time, and wann, awoo, and good morning at the same time, but NOT wann, awoo, yahoo, and good morning

due to this, wannawoo isnt its own thing, its just a combination people use a lot and doesnt need to be included

voice lines:
‚¨Ü means higher pitched

notes and tidbits:
the big crystal and the small crystal for the badges both make sounds when they appear and when they disappear (which can be used to tell where they spawn)
the super speed/jumpable emote glitch was changed to be slower but more controllable in the halloween 2022 update
the had to do it to em/goku drip pose glitch affects all animations, seriously, try out everything that has an animation
the hungry speed glitch can be done multiple times for more speed but decreased jump height, eventually you cant jump at all, so you can use the sit button to get out of chairs and stand up again
the train you use to get the nil badge has an invisible hitbox that you can find by running along the track (might require anti grief off), it's very wonky and teleports you around, but i think it is the box used for getting the badge, so if you can have a friend stand on top of it, you should always get teleported
urotsuki uses a different sound for anti grief, ive heard people say that its because the sound came from yume nikki, so since urotsuki is from yume 2kki, it uses the sounds from that instead
